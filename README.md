# Lok-Sabha-Election-Analysis-2014-vs-2019

### Project Overview
AtliQ Media is a private media company and they wanted to telecast a show on Lok Sabha elections 2024 in India. Unlike other channels they do not want to have a debate on who is going to win this election, they rather wanted to present insights from 2014 and 2019 elections without any bias and discuss less explored themes like voter turnout percentage in India.

### Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

- To analyze voter turnout percentages across various constituencies.
- To compare the performance of major political parties (INC and BJP) between 2014 and 2019.
- To identify constituencies with significant changes in party preferences and voter turnout.
- To provide meaningful visualizations of the findings.
- Analysis and Insights

**The analysis is divided into several key sections:**

- Voter Turnout Analysis: Examining the voter turnout percentage in different constituencies.
- Party Performance Comparison: Comparing the vote shares of INC and BJP in 2014 and 2019.
- Change in Party Preferences: Identifying constituencies where the winning party changed between 2014 and 2019.
- Top Constituencies by Vote Share Gain: Highlighting constituencies where INC and BJP gained significant vote shares.
- NOTA Analysis: Determining which constituency voted the most for NOTA.
